		// Created 3 variables. a holds the first Fibonacci number, b the second, and j is a placeholder for adding all odd values.
		var a = 0
		var b = 1
		var j = 0
		// Set the Fibonacci sequence to run by using a for loop. i is a counter variable. i counts to 30 as all Fibonacci values are still under 2,000,000 at this point.
		for(var i = 0; i < 31; i++){
			var c = b; // Set c to b, to hold b's value.
			b = b + a; // Added b to a to create the next number in the Fibonacci sequence.
			a = c; // Set a to c to hold c's value and so c can take on a new value. These 3 operations allow each variable to hold each number in the sequence as it progresses.
			if(c % 2 !== 0){ // Used an if statement and modulo to find all odd values. Each odd value is added to variable j.
				j += c;
			} else {
				j = j;
			}
		} 
		console.log(j); //Logged final sum.
