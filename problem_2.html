// First Variation 
	for(var number = 1; number <= 100; number++){ // Set for loop to count from 1 to 100 by increments of 1. 
		if(number % 3 === 0 && number % 5 !== 0){ // Set an if statement to find any factor of 3 that isn't also a factor of 5. 
			console.log("Fizz"); // Logged "Fizz" to the console in place of those factors. 
		} else if(number % 5 === 0){ // Set an else if statement to find factors of 5.
			console.log("Buzz"); // Logged "Buzz" to the console in place of those factors.
		} else{ // Set an else statement to log all remaining numbers as is.
			console.log(number);

// Second Variation 
	for(var number = 1; number <= 100; number++){ // Set the for loop to count from 1 to 100 by increments of 1.
		if(number % 3 === 0){ // Created an if statement inside of an if statement to find factors of three. If they were also factors of 5, "FizzBuzz" is logged, otherwise just "Fizz" is logged.
			if(number % 5 === 0){
				console.log("FizzBuzz");
			} else {
				console.log("Fizz");
			}
		} else if (number % 5 === 0){ // Created an else if statement to account for factors of 5 that aren't also factors of 3.
			console.log("Buzz");
		} else console.log(number); // Logged all other numbers to console as is.
